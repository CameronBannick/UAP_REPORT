# UFO Data Report

# Issue Adressed
Can we, with the data provided, predict shapes of ufos based on various features
# Data Provided
We were given a data set with a myriad of features and ended up only using DateTime, Shape, City longitude and latitude, state, month name, and day of the week.m
# Results 
If we wish to move forward on this project I will recommend the KNN model with the higher accuracy. However, all models performed poorly. I truly do believe we would have had better results if we kept the 'Duration' feature. The reason we could not is because the the large range of unique values that were not even numbers (ie 'CELLPHONE) my reccomendation is to run this model again with a cleaner duration feature and run the models again. Which I can do upon approval.
